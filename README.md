b3d-astar-pathfinding
===============

A* Pathfinding implementation for Blitz3D

Features
-----------
* Very fast! (uses Binary Heaps to sort points)
* Allows for asyncronous calculation (path can be calculated in multiple iterations)
* Works with all kinds of map representation (grids, waypoints, navmesh)
* Allows customization of heuristic function (default: euclidian distance)

Requisites
